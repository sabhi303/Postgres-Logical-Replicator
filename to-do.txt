//TO-DO

1. Refer : https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/sql-altersystem.html
   This can be done for setting wal_level instead of editing that file directly... --done

2. update create publication model ==> do something interesting

// For menu
   
   1. Write class specifics menus like:
      1. Main Menu -- main.py
      2. Publishers Menu
      3. Subscribers Menu

// Work-around
1. Issue : database restart
   - Installation's bin path can be taken from user and then can be restarted 
     as data directory can anyways be taken from postgresql query or already implemeted function


//To-worry

- While expanding
   1. Currently checking query status with status_message ...
      This needs to be changes as they may change This
